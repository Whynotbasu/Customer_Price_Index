# Customer Price Index (CPI) Trend Analysis

## üìä Project Overview

This project delves into the **Customer Price Index (CPI)** to analyze and visualize inflation trends, identify key contributing factors, and gain insights into the changing cost of living. Utilizing fundamental Python libraries like `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`, this analysis provides a clear picture of price dynamics over time and across various consumption categories.

**The primary goals of this project include:**
* Understanding historical CPI trends.
* Identifying categories with significant price fluctuations.
* Visualizing the impact of different sectors on overall inflation.
* Providing a foundational analysis for economic insights.

## ‚ú® Features & Analysis Highlights

* **Data Acquisition & Cleaning:** Handles loading of CPI data (e.g., from a CSV), cleaning, and preparing it for analysis.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Explores CPI trends over specified periods.
* **Categorical Breakdown:** Decomposes the overall CPI into major components (e.g., Food, Housing, Transportation, Healthcare).
* **Inflation Rate Calculation:** Calculates month-over-month or year-over-year inflation rates.
* **Impact Visualization:** Utilizes `Matplotlib` to create insightful visualizations, including:
    * Overall CPI trend lines.
    * Stacked area charts for category contributions.
    * Bar plots for inflation by category.
    * Heatmaps for correlation (if applicable to your data).
* **Key Insights:** Summarizes significant findings derived from the analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulation.
* **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation (DataFrames).
* **Matplotlib:** For static, high-quality data visualizations.
* *(Optional: Seaborn for enhanced statistical plots)*
* *(Optional: Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and presentation)*

## üöÄ How to Run the Analysis

To replicate this analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Price-Index-Analysis.git](https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Price-Index-Analysis.git)
    cd Customer-Price-Index-Analysis
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn # Add seaborn if used
    ```
4.  **Place your CPI data:**
    Ensure your CPI data (e.g., `cpi_data.csv`) is placed in the `data/` directory. You can obtain CPI data from official sources like the World Bank, your country's national statistics office (e.g., India's MoSPI, US BLS), or publicly available datasets on Kaggle.

5.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/CPI_Analysis.ipynb
    ```
    Follow the cells in the notebook to execute the analysis step-by-step.

## üìà Visualizations & Insights

*(This is where you'll embed your most compelling plots!)*

**1. Overall CPI Trend Over Time:**
![Overall CPI Trend](plots/cpi_trend.png)
*Insight: Briefly explain what this graph shows (e.g., "The graph above illustrates a steady increase in the overall CPI, indicating general inflationary pressure over the observed period.")*

**2. Contribution of Major Categories to CPI:**
![Category Contribution](plots/category_contribution.png)
*Insight: Highlight key categories and their impact (e.g., "Housing and Food consistently represent the largest components of the CPI, with notable shifts in their proportion during specific economic periods.")*

**3. Year-over-Year Inflation Rate:**
![Inflation Rate](plots/inflation_rate.png)
*Insight: Discuss the volatility or stability of inflation (e.g., "Annual inflation rates show periods of accelerated growth followed by moderation, reflecting various economic stimuli and global events.")*

*(Add more plots and insights as per your analysis. Make sure to export your plots from your Jupyter notebook to the `plots/` folder.)*

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

* Integrate more advanced time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
* Incorporate external economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, GDP, unemployment) to study correlations.
* Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., using Plotly Dash or Streamlit) for dynamic exploration.
* Expand analysis to compare CPI across different regions or countries.
